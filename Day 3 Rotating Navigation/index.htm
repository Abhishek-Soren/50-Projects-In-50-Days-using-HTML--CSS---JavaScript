        <h2 class="wrapper-content-subheading">Valorant: The Ultimate Tactical
          Shooter Experience</h2>
        <p class="wrapper-content-description">Valorant, developed by Riot
          Games, is a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter that has taken
          the gaming world by storm since its release. Combining precise gunplay
          with unique character abilities, Valorant offers a dynamic and
          strategic gameplay experience that keeps players on their

        <h2 class="wrapper-content-subheading">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p class="wrapper-content-description">In Valorant, players are divided
          into two teams of five, competing in a series of rounds with the
          primary objective of planting or defusing the Spike, depending on
          whether you are attacking or defending. Each round presents an
          opportunity to outmaneuver and outgun the opposition using a blend of
          skill, strategy, and team coordination.</p>

        <h2 class="wrapper-content-subheading">Agents and Abilities</h2>
        <p class="wrapper-content-description">Valorant's roster of Agents, each
          with their own unique abilities, sets it apart from other shooters.
          Players can choose from a diverse range of characters, such as
          Duelists who excel at taking down enemies, Sentinels who provide
          defensive support, Initiators who set the stage for offensive
          strategies, and Controllers who manipulate the battlefield to their
          advantage. Mastering an Agent's abilities, along with weapon
          proficiency, is key to securing victory.</p>
